Hello,
    I'm a software engineer, almost. My current interest is in web dev, particularly the functionality of front ends (I like making javascript do cool stuff), but I have yet to find a computer science related subject boring (with an exception made for html styling, ugh). My non-computer interests are martial arts, world mythology, soccer, obscure facts, karate, and crude jokes. I believe that learning should never be boring and all information can be made fun. In keeping with that the goal for this website is to take the rather lame subject of my uneventful life and make it fun, so check back every once in a while (time allowing, updates should be once a month or so) to see what new games each page holds.

    Good luck, have fun, and most importantly of all, be excellent to each other

    -Lara Janecka
